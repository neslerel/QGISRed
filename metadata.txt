about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a freeware QGIS plugin developed to assist in building hydraulic models of water distribution networks. The plugin works seamlessly with QGIS which enables the user to georeference all network elements, use geographic background layers, edit graphical and alphanumerical data, use geoprocessing tools, visualize data by layers, customize the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed relies on an easy-to-use relational database of SHP and DBF files based on the EPANET data model. In case the user decides to use the QGIS tools to edit the data, QGISRed provides powerful facilities to detect potential editing errors before simulating the model, or to fill in the missing information.</p><p align="justify">In addition, QGISRed provides numerous tools to help build and analyze models, such as:</p><li>Scenario manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Creation of new empty scenarios</li><li>Creation of a project backup</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files and external Shapefiles</li><li>Automatic generation of topological relationships between network elements</li><li>Editing tools for the basic network elements (add, delete, move, edit vertices and nodes, reverse links, multiple selection, etc.)</li><li>Topology tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default value allocation to newly created elements</li><li>Property editors for all element attributes, calculation options and default values</li><li>Automatic interpolation of node elevations</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness</li><li>Conversion of roughness coefficients between different headloss formulas and unit systems</li><li>Editing of multiple demands and quality sources integrated in the properties of the elements, and their visualization as separate layers</li><li>Powerful editors of curves, patterns, controls and rules</li><li>Validation anywhere of model properties against typical data entry errors</li><li>Auxiliary elements handling such as isolation valves, service connections, hydrants, washout valves, flowmeters, pressure sensors, etc.</li><li>Optional integration of some of these auxiliary elements into the model</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic sectors and demand zones</li><li>Model simulation by using the EPANET toolkit</li><li>Visualization of simulation results by means of tables, color coded theme layers, arrows and floating or static labels</li><li>Automatic creation of legends and symbols for the results (changeable with QGIS tools)</li><li>Time Browser to display simulation results</li><p align="justify">In order to improve the computing time, QGISRed uses binary libraries developed in .net, which constitutes the core of the GISRed standalone application.</p><p align="justify">The QGISRed plugin is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/research/research-groups/hydraulic-networks-and-pressurised-systems.html">REDHISP</a> Research Group of the Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (<a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/">IIAMA</a>) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, <a href="http://www.upv.es/index-en.html">UPV</a> (Spain), led by Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Martinez_Alzamora">Fernando Martínez Alzamora</a>.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=version 0.11:
      * Created a Json file to define the different projections (.prj file content) in case the Internet is not available
      * Implemented the reading of the PUMPS section formats inherited from Epanet version 1.1
      * New single installer for both architectures (x86 and x64)
      * The units and headloss formula are displayed in the status bar.
      * The estimation of roughness coefficients as a function of age and material support different headloss formulas and unit systems
      * Conversion of roughness coefficients between different headloss formulas and unit systems
      * Tool to create a project backup (manual restoration)
      * Fixed error when loading the plugin in QGIS version 3.14.15
      * Fixed error for not allowing to express the hours in a format other than AM/PM in the Controls section
      * Fixed error when not being able to take the user information from Windows in some computers
      * New blue color labels in results for line elements
      * Fixed error when cloning the project and losing the metadata
      * Fixed error when saving a result scenario and freezing the map
      * New alphabetical order in the link and node lists in the Simple Controls
