about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a freeware QGIS plugin developed to assist in building hydraulic models of water distribution networks. The plugin works seamlessly with QGIS which enables the user to georeference all network elements, use geographic background layers, edit graphical and alphanumerical data, use geoprocessing tools, visualize data by layers, customize the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed relies on an easy-to-use relational database of SHP and DBF files based on the EPANET data model. In case the user decides to use the QGIS tools to edit the data, QGISRed provides powerful facilities to detect potential editing errors before simulating the model, or to fill in the missing information.</p><p align="justify">In addition, QGISRed provides numerous tools to help build and analyze models, such as:</p><li>Scenario manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Creation of new empty scenarios</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files and external Shapefiles</li><li>Automatic generation of topological relationships between network elements</li><li>Editing tools for the basic network elements (add, delete, move, edit vertices and nodes, reverse links, multiple selection, etc.)</li><li>Topology tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default value allocation to newly created elements</li><li>Property editors for all element attributes, calculation options and default values</li><li>Automatic interpolation of node elevations</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness</li><li>Editing of multiple demands and quality sources integrated in the properties of the elements, and their visualization as separate layers</li><li>Powerful editors of curves, patterns, controls and rules</li><li>Validation anywhere of model properties against typical data entry errors</li><li>Auxiliary elements handling such as isolation valves, service connections, hydrants, washout valves, flowmeters, pressure sensors, etc.</li><li>Optional integration of some of these auxiliary elements into the model</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic sectors and demand zones</li><li>Model simulation by using the EPANET toolkit</li><li>Visualization of simulation results by means of tables, color coded theme layers, arrows and floating or static labels</li><li>Automatic creation of legends and symbols for the results (changeable with QGIS tools)</li><li>Time Browser to display simulation results</li><p align="justify">In order to improve the computing time, QGISRed uses binary libraries developed in .net, which constitutes the core of the GISRed standalone application.</p><p align="justify">The QGISRed plugin is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/research/research-groups/hydraulic-networks-and-pressurised-systems.html">REDHISP</a> Research Group of the Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (<a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/">IIAMA</a>) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, <a href="http://www.upv.es/index-en.html">UPV</a> (Spain), led by Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Martinez_Alzamora">Fernando Martínez Alzamora</a>.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=version 0.10:
      * Fixed not correct behaviour in create/import tools when other layers are open.
      * Headers of the INP sections written in English.
      * Validation in element properties to prevent same final node in lines.
      * Fixed error when importing tanks.
      * Improved simplification of vertices to eliminate repetitions at the starting point.
      * Fixed error writing the Times of Options.
      * Metadata restructuring, now unified in the *_Metadata.txt file.
      * Fixed error joining pipes with the same characteristics when they start and end in the same node.
      * Check for new versions and notify the user.
      * Fixed icons display in the legend for QGis version 3.12
      * Fixed bug that prevented saving result styles.
      * Fixed error in decimal symbol reading when the user uses the English format and changes the decimal symbol by comma.
      * EditProject switches to LayerManagement to control visibility of layers and their creation.
      * Now the projection is correctly saved in the PRJ file.
      * New window with project options.
      * Separation between Import (without project - INP or SHPs) and Add data (with project - only SHPs).
      * Spatial tolerance when importing/adding data from SHPs.
      * Manual includes ascii file format for elevation interpolation and classification of the 4 types of hydraulic sectors.
      * Simplified 4 layers of meters in only 1.
      * Fixed error when writing SHPs of issues in valves and pumps.
      * Methods to assign roughness, check overlapping elements, aligned vertices, lengths, material, diameter or installation date now also for selected elements.
      * Fixed error in very specific case when creating individual T-connections.
      * New dependency management to avoid errors if they are in use.
